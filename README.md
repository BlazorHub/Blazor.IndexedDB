# Tg.Blazor.IndexedDB
This is Blazor library for accessing IndexedDB and uses Jake Archibald's [idb library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb) for handling access to IndexedDB on the JavaScript side. 

This version currently provides the following functionality.
* Open and upgrade an instance of IndexedDB, creating stores
* Add and update a record to/in a given store
* Delete a record from a store 
* Retrieve all records from a given store
* Retrieve a record/or records from a store by index and value if the index exists

It does not, at the moment, support aggregate keys, searches using a range and some of the more obscure features of IndexedDB.

## Using the library

1. create a new instance of DbStore
2. add one or more store definitions
3. Inject the created instance of IndexedDbManger into the component or page where you want to use it

The library provides a service extension to create a singleton instance of the DbStore.

Within the client application's startup.cs file, add the following to the ```ConfigureServices``` function.

```CSharp
services.AddIndexedDB(dbStore =>
            {
                dbStore.DbName = "TheFactory"; //example name
                dbStore.Version = 1;

            dbStore.Stores.Add(new StoreSchema
            {
                Name = "Employees",
                PrimaryKey = new IndexSpec { Name = "id", KeyPath = "id", Auto = true },
                Indexes = new List<IndexSpec>
                    {
                        new IndexSpec{Name="firstName", KeyPath = "firstName", Auto=false},
                        new IndexSpec{Name="lastName", KeyPath = "lastName", Auto=false}

                    }
            });
                dbStore.Stores.Add(new StoreSchema
                {
                    Name = "Outbox",
                    PrimaryKey = new IndexSpec { Auto = true }
                }
                    );
            });
```
### A breakdown of what this does




## Using IndexedDBManager
For the following examples we are going to assume that we have Person class which is defined as follows:

```CSharp
 public class Person
    {
        public long? Id { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }

    }
```
And the data store name is "Employees"

### Accessing IndexedDBManager
To use IndexedDB in a component or page first inject the IndexedDbManager instance.
```CSharp
@inject IndexedDBManager DbManager
``` 
### Setting up notifications
IndexedDBManager exposes ```ActionCompleted``` event that is raised when an action is completed. 

If you want to receive notifications in the ```OnInit()`` function subscribe to the event.

The function that handles the event should have the following signature:
```CSharp
 private void OnIndexedDbNotification(object sender, IndexedDBNotificationArgs args)
    {
        Message = args.Message;
    }
```

It is recommended that your page or component should also implement IDisposable to unsubscribe from the event.

### Adding a record to an IndexedDb store
Assuming we have a new instance of our sample ```Person``` class, to add to the "Employees" store doing the following:

```CSharp
var newRecord = new StoreRecord<Person>
        {
            Storename ="Employees",
            Data = NewPerson
        };

await DbManager.AddRecord(newRecord);
```

### Getting all records from a store

```CSharp
 var results = await DbManager.GetRecords<Person>("Employees");
 ```

### getting a record using the index
B

### Updating a record

### Deleting a record

### Query by index key
